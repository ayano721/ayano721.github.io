I'm a researcher working on **photorealistic digital humans**, **non-rigid 3D reconstruction**, and **neural rendering**.

My current focus is on developing efficient 3D reconstruction methods for human avatars, leveraging recent advances in spatial AI, volumetric rendering, and neural scene representations.
